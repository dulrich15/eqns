- Finding it very difficult to include 2D projectile problems in the eqns app.
- Also, how to incorporate definition of equilibrium? Vector sum? Seems like
  anything involving *geometry* is causing an issue.
- Avoiding geometry requires interpreting all these equations as relating
  *magnitudes* only, not vectors.
- Dealing with energy is surprizingly difficult. Perhaps power is the primary
  quantity here, rather than work?
